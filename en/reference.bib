	abstract = {Identifying influential spreaders is crucial for understanding and controlling spreading processes on social networks. Via assigning degree-dependent weights onto links associated with the ground node, we proposed a variant to a recent ranking algorithm named LeaderRank (L?? et al., 2011). According to the simulations on the standard SIR model, the weighted LeaderRank performs better than LeaderRank in three aspects: (i) the ability to find out more influential spreaders; (ii) the higher tolerance to noisy data; and (iii) the higher robustness to intentional attacks. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Besides attracting a billion dollar economy, Bitcoin revolu-tionized the field of digital currencies and influenced many adjacent areas. This also induced significant scientific inter-est. In this survey, we unroll and structure the manyfold results and research directions. We start by introducing the Bitcoin protocol and its building blocks. From there we continue to explore the design space by discussing existing contributions and results. In the process, we deduce the fun-damental structures and insights at the core of the Bitcoin protocol and its applications. As we show and discuss, many key ideas are likewise applicable in various other fields, so that their impact reaches far beyond Bitcoin itself.},
